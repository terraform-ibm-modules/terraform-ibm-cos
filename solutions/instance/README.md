# Cloud Object Storage instance solution

This architecture creates a Cloud Object Storage instance on IBM CloudÂ® and supports provisioning the following resources:

- A resource group, if one is not passed in.
- A Cloud Object Storage instance on IBM Cloud.

NB: This solution is not intended to be called by one or more other modules since it contains a provider configurations, meaning it is not compatible with the `for_each`, `count`, and `depends_on` arguments.
