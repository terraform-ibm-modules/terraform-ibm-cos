# Financial Services Cloud Profile

This is a profile for COS that meets FS Cloud requirements. This profile assumes you are deploying into an already compliant account.
It has been scanned by [IBM Code Risk Analyzer (CRA)](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/code-risk-analyzer-cli-plugin?topic=code-risk-analyzer-cli-plugin-cra-cli-plugin#terraform-command) and meets all applicable goals.

## Note: If no Context Based Restriction(CBR) rules are passed, you must configure Context Based Restrictions externally to be compliant.
